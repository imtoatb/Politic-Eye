            <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

            <h2>What's this website for ?</h2>
            <p>Politic'eye is a project aiming to bring to everyone clear information on our political representatives. Our content, aimed mostly at abstentionists or low-informed voters, is there to help people make their own judgment on the plethora of politicians in the public debate before voting. As goes the democratic principles, the consent of the people to be governed must be not only free, but informed.</p>

            <h2>How do I use it ?</h2>
            <p>Simply click on the "list" page to access the list of politicians currently registered in our database. As you navigate through the links, you will be presented with a report with elementary information on the person, their list of mandates, their conflict of interests, their scandals and condemnations. Politic'eye reminds that, as the presumption of innocence still holds, any report outside of the scope of the condemnations sections does not imply automatic guilt. It is only the information and investigations brought by our selected panel of media to provide viable information.</p>

            <h2>Can I participate ?</h2>
            <p>At the politic'eye team, we are all human beings. With our knowledge and interest diff√©rences, we cannot singlehandedly curate and report our findings on the database. Thus why, any visitor's contribution is welcome. Feel free to go to the Feedback page and give us any information, or message that you want to transmit to better the website. Outside contributions are fundamental to the experience we want to realize.</p>

            <h2>Can I contact the team ?</h2>
            <p>For the moment, the only option is to fill the feedback form with at least your contact and check that you want to be contacted. As time goes, we may put online an official contact for diverse inquiries, but due to safety reasons we prefer to have proper time to think about it.</p>

            <h2>Can I join the project ?</h2>
            <p>This would be absolutely amazing to bring new people to our cause. For the reasons mentioned above, it is quite uneasy to formally bring people into the team. Feel free to send a feedback with your contact information, and we shall process with internal vetting of your application.</p>

            <h2>How are you financed ?</h2>
            <p>We are currently receiving funds and support only through the sheer passion and benevolent support of our team members. No institutions nor corporate entity sponsors this website. If you would like to support us and get a thank you in this page, you may try to contact us. We will try to create a mechanism for our future supporters to help us as the projects grows.</p>
